Notes:
To move pieces, click the piece then the square you want to move that piece to

Press Space to skip text boxes

To win attack the opponent king 3 times

The game will allow you to hang your king, and that will be immediate loss:

Breaking absolute pins

Not protecting your king while in check

Special case: if white checked black, and black delivered a final checkmate, THEN white wins because black didn't care about their king safety and hung it



### Salty origin story:
In the evening of September/4/2022, I played my first rapid rated chess tournament at the St. Louis Chess Club. My very first game was against a fellow Indiana University student who I had just met earlier in STL, coincidentally. Rated 400 ELO points lower than my opponent, my chances of winning the game were only 9.09%. https://www.318chess.com/elo.html

However, I managed to outplay my opponent who wasn't familiar with "Caro-Kann Advanced 3...c5" variation in the opening and middle-game phases. The only problem was that I was getting low on time as we approached the end-game phase. And in a messy (REALLY MESSY) time scramble, all the other players and audience were watching our game; we were the last board of the round. As I kept getting lower and lower on time, my opponent kept putting more pressure on my position, and I accidentally moved my king to e3 which was covered by an enemy pawn. Therefore, I hung my king.. The arbiter saw it, but decided not to interfere as we were really just throwing moves hoping not to lose on time. I left my king in check for yet another move. And as I hit the clock, I dropped my king as a sign of resignation.

It was a sad game, and I'm still salty about that loss.  

That's why I decided to allow players to hang their kings in this game, at their own expense of course!
